# Introduction-to-Problem-Solving Assignment:

### Course: Introduction to Problem Solving

#### Subject: Computer Science

Assignment Title: Comprehensive Problem Solving ProjectObjective:
This assignment aims to integrate all the key concepts covered in the course.

Students will apply problem-solving techniques, algorithm design, flowchart creation, pseudocode writing, basic programming constructs, and debugging skills.Instructions:
You will complete a comprehensive project that involves the following components:

• Define the problem clearly.
• Analyze the problem to understand the requirements and constraints.
• Design a step-by-step algorithm to solve the problem.
• Create a flowchart to represent the algorithm visually.
• Write pseudocode to outline the solution in a structured manner.
• Implement the solution in a programming language (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
• Ensure your code is well-documented with comments.
• Test your program with various input cases to ensure correctness.
• Debug any issues that arise during testing.

Problems to Solve:
Problem 1: Student Grades Management System
Design and implement a system to manage student grades. The system should allow users to:Add a new student.Record grades for students.Calculate the average grade for each student.Determine the highest and lowest grades in the class.Display all student records.

• Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to represent the steps for managing student grades.
• Write pseudocode for adding a student, recording grades, calculating averages, finding highest and lowest grades, and displaying records.
• Implement the system in a programming language of your choice.
• Test the system with multiple student records and grades.

Problem 2: Simple Banking System
Design and implement a simple banking system. The system should allow users to:Create a new account.Deposit money into an account.Withdraw money from an account.Check the balance of an account.Transfer money between accounts.

• Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart to represent the steps for the banking operations.
• Write pseudocode for creating an account, depositing, withdrawing, checking balance, and transferring money.
• Implement the system in a programming language of your choice.
• Test the system with various banking operations and edge cases (e.g., insufficient funds).

Problem 3: Library Management System
Design and implement a system to manage a library. The system should allow users to:Add new books to the library.Borrow books from the library.Return books to the library.Display all available books.Track overdue books.

• Write an algorithm and draw a flowchart representing the steps for managing library operations.
• Write pseudocode for adding books, borrowing, returning, displaying books, and tracking overdue books.
• Implement the system in a programming language of your choice.
• Test the system with various library operations and scenarios (e.g., borrowing a book that is not available).

Submission:

• Write a clear problem definition and analysis for each problem.
• Save the document as Problem_Definition.txt.
• Write the algorithms and draw the flowcharts for each problem.
• Save the algorithms in a document as Algorithms.txt.
• Save the flowcharts as image files (e.g., Flowchart_Grades.png, Flowchart_Banking.png, etc.).
• Write the pseudocode for each problem.
• Save the document as Pseudocode.txt.
• Implement the solutions in a programming language of your choice.
• Save the source code files (e.g., GradesSystem.py, BankingSystem.java, etc.).
• Document the test cases and results for each problem.
• Save the document as Test_Cases_Results.txt.
• Combine all the files into a single compressed file (Comprehensive_Project.zip).
• Submit the compressed file to the designated submission portal.

Evaluation Criteria:

• Solutions correctly address the given problems.
• Problem definitions, algorithms, pseudocode, and flowcharts are clear and logically structured.
• Programs work as expected and handle various input cases correctly.
• Flowcharts and diagrams are neatly drawn and easy to understand.
• Code is well-documented with comments, and test cases/results are clearly recorded.
• All components (problem definition, algorithms, flowcharts, pseudocode, code, tests) are included in the submission.

This comprehensive project will help you apply and integrate various problem-solving techniques learned throughout the course, providing a solid foundation in problem-solving and programming.
